Running uv by doing:
"cd backend", "uvicorn main:app --reload"

running into problem when running via uvicorn, only first page of pdf is being put in calendar
START WITH PRINTF DEBUGGING FIRST

How to debug this(from chatgpt):
Add lots of detailed logging or print statements before and after important steps inside main to pinpoint exactly where it stops.

Use timeouts on external calls or APIs to avoid indefinite waiting.

Make sure all async calls are properly awaited, and no sync blocking calls are called inside async functions.

Run your code with a debugger and set breakpoints inside main to see how far it goes.

Temporarily simplify main to a minimal version and gradually add complexity back until the hang appears.

Check if any third-party library you use is known to have issues when used in async contexts or certain environments.


Fixes Tried for stopping at first page:
    
    making all required functions async
